# E-commerce Front-end
This repository consists of 2 separate front-end projects which are cliets for my microservice project. Let me give you general overview of these front-ends.

 :heavy_check_mark: Local-storage based cart functionality
 
## Admin panel

 :heavy_check_mark: Administrator Login (separate route)
 
 :heavy_check_mark: Edit and add new users
 
 :heavy_check_mark: Edit product details and add new ones
 
 :heavy_check_mark: Change orders' status according to your products in stock
